**Features** ‚ú®
- Interactive Model Exploration: Load and test different transformer models directly in your browser.
- User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes Gradio to create an accessible web-based UI.
- Flexible Pipeline Selection: Choose from a variety of pipelines such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To set up the Transformers Pipeline Playground locally, follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/canstralian/transformers-pipeline-playground.git
cd transformers-pipeline-playground


	2.	Install Dependencies:
It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

Then, install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage üöÄ

After installing the dependencies, you can launch the application with:

python app.py

This will start a local server. Open your browser and navigate to the displayed URL to access the interface.

How It Works üß†

The application leverages Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers library to load pre-trained models and create pipelines for various NLP tasks. The user interface is built with Gradio, providing an easy way to interact with the models.
